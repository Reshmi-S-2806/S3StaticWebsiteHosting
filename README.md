Static Website Hosting on Amazon S3

This project demonstrates how to host a fully static website (HTML/CSS) on **Amazon S3**.  
It covers bucket creation, configuring public access, enabling static website hosting, and resolving permissions issues using the correct bucket policy.

Project Overview

I deployed a simple static website using **Amazon S3 Static Website Hosting**.  
The website files (index.html, style.css, and assets) were uploaded to an S3 bucket, configured for public hosting, and made accessible through an S3 website endpoint.
